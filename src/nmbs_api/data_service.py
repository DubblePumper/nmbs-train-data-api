NMBS Data Service - Main Module

This is a refactored version of the NMBS Data Service using a modular architecture
for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

The original monolithic service has been split into specialized services:
- BaseService: Common functionality for all services
- ScraperService: Web scraping to extract data URLs
- DownloaderService: Downloading data files
- ParserService: Parsing and filtering data files
- DataService: Main service integrating the others

This file acts as the main entry point for backward compatibility.
